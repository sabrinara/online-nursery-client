                <p className="mb-4">
                    As soon as your order is placed, we begin the process of carefully preparing it for shipment. We do our best to get shipments out as soon as possible. Therefore, in order to make timely adjustments, cancellations and changes to your order must be received within 12 hours of purchase or prior to receiving a shipping notification.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p className="mb-4">
                    All sales are final. Due to the perishable nature of most of our products, NatureNest does not accept returns. Non-living items like fertilizers, grass seed, planting soil, watering bags, hoses, pots, and other non-perishable garden items can be returned at the customerâ€™s expense. Upon arrival, these items will be reviewed and must be received in saleable condition. Once approved, we will issue a refund minus a 20% restocking fee. Shipping costs are non-refundable. Accepting the delivery of the product means the customer agrees to NatureNest's terms and conditions of sale. In no circumstance will NatureNest's liability exceed the cost paid for the order.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    We are very careful to label varieties true to name, but sometimes mistakes happen. In the unlikely event that an incorrect plant is sent, we will replace the product at our expense. We do not offer refunds for incorrectly shipped products, only replacements or store credit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customers acknowledge that they understand the specific plant's type and requirements as posted on each product page. NatureNest will not replace or refund any items where the customer purchased the wrong plant.

                    Our outdoor plant photos are of mature or established landscape plants. Indoor plant photos range in maturity and container size. All plants sold by NatureNest are younger plants and will ship in standard nursery pots unless otherwise specified.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Dormant Plants</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Most outdoor trees and plants enter dormancy or semi-dormancy in the fall through spring (some perennials enter dormancy in late spring or early summer). NatureNest will send out viable dormant plant materials early in the spring or late in the fall and winter seasons. These plants are completely healthy but may exhibit fewer leaves, discoloration, or complete leaf drop during this period. This is normal and essential for the plant's health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Planting during dormancy promotes root growth, giving your plant a better start in spring when new foliage begins to grow.

                    Growth rates on our website are estimates based on historical data and assume optimal growing conditions. Growing plants requires a suitable site, compatible environment, and proper care. These conditions are beyond our control. By accepting these terms and conditions, customers agree that the images used on product pages represent what the product will look like when it reaches maturity. Plants are shown in decorative containers for display purposes only and are shipped in standard nursery containers unless otherwise specified.
